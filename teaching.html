<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h2>Current teaching</h2>

<p>
   In the Fall 2025 semester, I will be teaching two sections of Probability (MATH 230/STAT 230) at Duke University.
</p>

<h2>Past teaching</h2>

<p> 
  During the Spring 2025 semester, I was teaching a section of Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH-UA 262) at the NYU College of Arts and Sciences.
  During the Fall 2024 semester, I was teaching a section of Introduction to Mathematical Modeling (MATH-UA 251) at the NYU College of Arts and Sciences. During the Fall 2023 semester, I was teaching a section of Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) at the NYU College of Arts and Sciences. During the Spring 2023 semester, I was teaching Applied Complex Variables (MA-UY 4434) at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. For students who were in these classes, materials are still available on <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/">Brightspace</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  During the Winter 2022 semester, I was teaching the (only) two groups of L3 students for <i>Anglais mathématique</i> at CY Cergy Paris Université. Course materials and details about evaluations are still available to sutdents through their ENT.
</p>

<p>
  During the Winter 2020 semester, I taught one of eleven groups of L1 students for <a href="https://chamilo.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/main/course_description/?cidReq=UGA002679&id_session=0&gidReq=0&gradebook=0&origin="><i>Introduction à la biologie mathématique et à la dynamique des populations</i></a> at Université Grenoble Alpes, coordinated by <a href="https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~dpiau/enseignement.html">Didier Piau</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Between 2014 and 2021, I have been a grader, an assistant or a substitute for different undergraduate and graduate analysis courses at McGill University.
